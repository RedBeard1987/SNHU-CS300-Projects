# SNHU-CS300-Projects

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  
  For CS300 we were learning about different algorithms and their run time capabilities. The project was working with an advising team to create a program to see courses and their prerequisites for Computer Science degree.
  Using different algorithms such as hash tables, binary search trees and vectors was the best way to determine different run time analysis for each program and be able to choose the best option for the program at hand.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  
  Different algorithms have different challenges. Most challenges I faced was with my coding skills. Being able to code a program and have it work the way it was intended can be a big task. Lots of trial and error. I have gotten better at enabling loops in a program.
  

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  
  Maintaining a positive attitude when doing trial and error coding is key. Doing a lot of reserch and being able to try multiple different methods to find the best overall outcome was my key success for this course. 
  Reviewing the errors I was getting and taking time to process those errors and how to correct them. I used geek for geeks and stackoverflow for coding help when needed. There a lot of examples of different style coding for multiple different algorithms. Finding the       best for your program is key. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  
  Designing this program has helped me grow as a programmer by using different methods during coding and opened my eyes to different algorithms that will do the same job but at different speeds. Knowing what works may not be the best result. But doing it with the fastest   result still doesn't make it the best. Combining the program needs with the user needs is key to a properly designed program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
  I have always been good at having proper documentation of a program design to ensure the next programmer understands the program functions, but ensuring I include a good description of  what a properly working program should do, helps every programmer after me be able   to understand the code and every function designed with in it. By ensuring this it allows for proper maintenance of the designed program.
